This is a private project to train my HTML, CSS, and javaScript.

It is a tip calculator. 

It takes the bill, adds a certain percentage of the bill to the bill (percentage is dependent upon
selected quality of service), then divided by number of people who split the bill.

It was a simple project. Test it for yourself at  https://mpavcell.github.io/tipcalculator/
